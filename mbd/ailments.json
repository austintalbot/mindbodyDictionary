You may consider setting an alarm or timer for these breaks. During these pauses, practice breathing in intervals of 7 long breaths followed by 2 short breaths for 2 minutes. \n\nLook or imagine looking into nature during these pauses—observe trees, hills, and clouds. Appreciate the beauty and wonder. Then, focus on your hand or a nearby flower with a sense of wonder. Return to the moment and engage your heart with exercises, followed by calming down with some push-ups.\n\nApply a similar approach for your mind. Quickly jot down what you're excited or hyper about, then write slowly about the purpose behind it all. Choose one item from the list and enjoy the action.

      "summaryNegative": "Coping with stress makes you feel that life is dangerous and not safe to communicate freely and openly.\n\nYou want to relax but your body takes over with tightness of breath, shakiness, tight muscles, and head pressure.\n\nRather than trusting life, you try to control it with your thoughts, feelings and actions.\n\nYou are struggling to connect to your capacity to create positive change in your life, and this makes the future seem particularly frightening.\n\nYou fear your own anger, as well as any conflict it may bring, so you suppress it.\n\nYou are frustrated and angry with the way things are, but fear overrides the confidence to address it.\n\nYour worries tighten muscles in your body as if you are afraid to run, but you wish you could just go and be somewhere else without all the concerns that haunt you.\n\nYou want to say what is on your mind, but your heart believes it will only get worse if you do.\n\nYou use your anxiety to stay alert and busy so that you can avoid looking at something that might be overwhelming.\n\nIf you keep being too perfectionistic, you become overly “procrastinistic” to deal with what is most important.\n\nIt is so difficult to see the forest from the trees because your thoughts branch off into scattered thoughts and feelings just trying to avoid what is scaring you.  Thus, you are hiding within your tangled-up forest of life experience.",
      "summaryPositive": "The goal is to embrace each moment in life as an opportunity to experience and learn. Even though it is difficult to see the bigger picture, it is helpful to take moments to stop and pause your life. Permit yourself to feel each emotion that flows through your life’s experience. Learn from these experiences. As you do this, face your anger. Don’t fear it, suppress it, or give in to it in a way that will cause harm to yourself or others. Rather, allow it to motivate you with the courage that it takes to make the positive changes that you seek. This may be a challenge, and it takes practice, but you will get better as you remain aware of what is going on within you.\n\nWhen someone tells you to “go with the flow,” you might resist it and become more stressed. Because you need to be in so much control that your body and mind thinks “being in control” is more important than feeling calm and relaxed. It is time to decide what is safe for you. Start simple. Start with feeling safe with the earth and nature. Start with feeling safe with breath and awareness. Do some interval paced breathing where you breathe 5 slow breaths, 1 regular breath, and then 1 quick breath. Do this interval for 3 to 4 times to reset your breathing pattern. Touch your body on the arms, legs, belly to let yourself feel you. Take moments to honor your simple thoughts.\n\nAnytime you are in a tight spot inside, find a safe place in your life. Most of what you fear is your mind and body trying to find a way to make you safe. But it doesn’t work because it is not based on reality or truth. It is based on perceptions and possibilities that spin you into fear. Take the crazy spiral of excessive thinking and gradually slow the spin to a calm wave. Visualize the ocean calmly moving a wave back and forth washing over you and through you, bringing you into a nice simple movement of peaceful energy.",

      "summaryNegative": "It feels as if you are being held hostage from within.\nYour automatic reflex of holding your breath is based on a deep fear of losing someone, being abandoned, or being smothered.\nIn addition, eventually there is an obvious fear that there won't be enough air, love, space, time, and connection.\nIn your fear of abandonment or smothering, you think that you have only one option, that is to hold on tight.\nYou are in a closed loop of panic and concern.\nThe thoughts of \"what if\" come storming in, but you already are having a storm inside, so there is no room left for more turmoil.\nThe anxiety is overtaking your mind and is becoming your single focus.",
      "summaryPositive": "Try embracing the moment of fear and high stress with some simple mindfulness techniques. First, use some reverse psychology on yourself by embracing the fear, holding your breath for 3 seconds, and then letting go. Do it again and then let go. Watch the tightness and fear reduce as you flow with the fear and then release it. Your brain thinks that you are getting enough oxygen, when in reality you are not letting go of the excess carbon dioxide.\n\nHolding on to the fear of being abandoned is keeping you isolated inside from others and from life. Embrace your fear by increasing it intentionally in order to show the brain that the fear is worse than reality. Letting go is scary if you are a small child that is subconsciously needing to be attached to something because some people are unpredictable, but the mind thinks that holding on to the breath is going to keep you aware and safe.\n\nTake this one step and one breath at a time. Breathe in a little and walk a little. Breathe in and out a little longer and walk a little farther. Doing an interval breath that allows you to breathe a few long breaths and two short breaths while walking a few long slow steps and then a couple of fast steps, helps reset the mind and the body.\n\nTrust in your body is difficult if your body doesn’t trust you and your mind. Taking the time to listen to your body and learning intuition helps establish good rapport. \n\nEstablishing a positive connection and respecting the body will help build the bridge between your emotions, feelings, body reactions, and your mind. Your best friend can be your very own body, if you decide to listen and respond with understanding to you and your body.",

Then in burnout, it is even that much more difficult. \nYou are fighting your own uphill battle. \nYou view life that you are carrying even burdens you, like you are going uphill in a snowstorm with the wind blowing in your face.\nIf suffering were an art form it would look dark, heavy, hopeless, frustrating, and endless.",

The driver is holding the key, and if you fight the driver, you will exhaust yourself and be left standing in the fumes. \n\nThe driver of burnout is afraid of something or someone or some possible outcome. The driver inside may be too perfectionistic, or too competitive, or too worried, or too confused. No matter what the problem is, stop and get a handle on your core needs and values, and compare them to what you are doing. If your core values don't match your thoughts and actions, then take the time to clean up your thoughts, emotions, and actions. \n\nSimply, simply and oh yeah, simply. Come back home to yourself.

This makes loving feel heavy, leaving you exhausted rather than rejuvenated. \nYou keep insisting others need to change rather than finding what needs to change within yourself. \nBeing honest, and therefore vulnerable with your sadness feels too frightening and unsafe to attempt.\nEvery day the inner conflicts grow deeper and stronger. \nEvery day you are pushing the denial of what is really going inside of you while desiring to have things be different on the outside. \nConsider how you go forward, thinking that things might change. \nYou are wishing that the other person would be different, longing for love from someone who doesn't know how to speak your love language and hoping for some outcome that is not possible, while the other person or people keep acting a certain way. \nWishes are like fishes, swimming around without any control.

See that the bully in them is covering up their pain and fear. Have your body bury the pain and sensitivity in the earth. Listen to those who honestly care for you. Listen only to the valid respectful words of others. \n\nStretch, breathe, and renew your thoughts daily.

See that the other person has needs that are immature and start there to understand them. Understanding can open the door to letting go of pain and festering emotions.

In other words, your anxiety, and constantly thinking about what should have been, what could have been, or what might happen, is bugging you so much, that you try to ignore what actually is happening. Instead, you push yourself forward. \nYou tend to be critical as you hold onto the past and withhold your love from life. \nYou're blaming and hating others for your emotional pain. \nYou feel confused, irritated, embarrassed, and frustrated about what has happened and can't see past the dark clouds of the past to enjoy the light of possibility. \nYou insist that your mistakes or flaws make you unlovable and create 'self-fulfilling prophecies' to reinforce that belief. \nYou'd rather just 'through it all out' than to face it. \nGuilt and self-blame leads to a subtle shame that no one can fix because your inner dialogue is assuring you that you are \"bad\" or the \"problem.\" \nRarely are the constipated thoughts and feelings of an individual true. For if they were true, the problem would show up in another way and not constipation. \nYes, you have made mistakes, and you are not perfect. \nYou are constantly thinking of ways to be more perfect or be better.

The problem is that you won't let go of the self-criticism that you made a mistake. The energy of shame is worse than the mistake that you made. \n\nYou can build the courage and fortitude it takes to be true to your human side and your divine side.

However, you feel a strong urge to eat something containing gluten to fulfill your craving.\nYou want deeper sweetness in life than what you are getting from anyone close to you. \nHow many times have you been stressed and you couldn't help yourself and you grabbed some bread until you couldn't stop eating until you were full of it? \nHave you noticed that when you act out your cravings for gluten, you feel worse? This is because the body is in a vicious cycle of pain from engaging in ‘pleasure.’ \nThe endorphins that come from eating the gluten are feeding the problem instead of solving it. \nEating your problems away are showing you that your problems are eating you.",

Being present in the here and now will help you see what you are escaping and what you are chasing. The immature self is driving you away from growing up. \n\nIt is time to embrace the fear of starvation and realize you won't. What you are running from is the thought that you will never ever be happy, get what you want, or be taken care of. \n\nIt’s time to be real and authentic with yourself and slowly step into greater a genuine experience of life. Eating what is healthy and helpful first, then consider pleasure from another source, such as, walking, breathing, laughing. Joyful laughter will fill your heart, so you don't have to use harmful reactive foods to harm your life. Change your view, open your eyes, open your heart to new experiences before you satisfy something that takes instead of gives.",

Because if you don't, the two intermingle into a painful self - that is tainted with frustration or shame. \n\nThere is no real and true love in a painful, shameful, or frustrated-based sexual act. It becomes a routine and thus is not real enjoyment but an addictive pattern. It is time to change the patterns by changing the root of the experience. Start by drawing, writing, breathing, stretching out your suffering, judgments, and justifications. \n\nTake notice when your craving is based on stress relief and when it is simply a desire to connect. It is a lie to think you have to have sex or any other craving because your craving is ruling your mind and body. Desiring sex is cleaner and rewarding. Craving it is depleting and deceiving self. Real love has nothing to do with sex. Real love has to do with deep connection with touch, respect, joy, sharing, oneness, and openness.",

      "summaryPositive": "When you feel the desire to control others in order to get what you want: stop first and consider the consequences. You lose more in your relationships when you are controlling than what you gain in being right. \n\nThe same applies to eating. If you try to suppress your cravings for love, attention, and control, with eating excess foods, processed foods, or overly sweetened foods, then you will suffer a consequence of your body suffering. You use foods to suppress the emotions because you feel a need to escape reality. You acknowledge that you have made excuses, but your attitude is just pushing the emotions away and 'go on with life.' Feeling any shame, guilt, or sadness is much too painful. Instead, you resolve to find happy communication, interesting conversation, trying to control situations, or having angry forceful moments. \n\nLook at your need to win as a positive push to find answers for your problems, but not to control. Look at the need for sweets as a positive push to create valid and authentic relationships that include respect, honor, and gratitude. See that your craving for sweets is an indication of the lack of mature patience to walk yourself through discomfort to strength in your character. It is time to let go of the fear of discomfort, fear of failure, resentments to others and situations, the false sweetness, fear of judgments, and attacking words to others. It is time to embrace authentic expression and valid trust in yourself and others. ",

      "summaryNegative": "You have only one agenda behind the many thoughts that rush through your mind; how to be safe. \nYour need to be safe is more important than logic, and more important than truth and peace. \nIf peace were your main purpose, then you would find a way to work through and face your fear. \nCourage is far away because you don't trust others, the situations, God, nor yourself. \nFear comes as a natural survival instinct, but if used excessively, the mind becomes too narrow in its thinking, and the heart tightens in turmoil. \nThe stress on the body makes you pay a painful toll that ages and sickens you. \nWhile you are wishing, your body is overreacting, but you are not taking action. \nYou have become more irresponsible with your thoughts and feelings. \nYou are in a state of lacking control. \nNotice the damage you are creating by focusing your hurt and pain from the past and forecasting it onto a possible future. \nMost likely, most of the futures you are imagining will not materialize no matter how many times the fear of it all cycles in your head.",

Fear is meant to keep you alive in dangerous situations. And so far, you are surviving, but living in survival is not thriving. Fear is a signpost, but you have made it a roadblock. \n\nFear is a gift if it keeps you from falling off the cliff, but a curse if you never venture on any new path. Notice how fear effects your life. Notice where it comes from. Be wise not to blame your life on why you have fear. Fear is fear, your reaction to fear is what is spinning you in circles. \n\nTake the time each day to embrace the possibilities of learning and growing from listening to your inner self. Take heart by allowing a gradual courage in facing life as a challenge, not an obstacle. If you want to find the real excitement of life, turn the fear inside out and let it be a part of your daily adventure of mindful discovery.",

You end up being forceful in your actions rather than moving with gracefulness when trying to avoid unpleasant future outcomes. \nYour rigid nature is not your natural state. \nIt happened over time because you tried to control too much, and then you coped with life by thinking and feeling too many negative things about your life and others. \nBitterness builds up from hopeful expectations that did not come about. \nThe gradual accumulation of resentment makes you more inflexible and painful.

You may have thought that if you were sweet enough, kind enough, or even mean enough, then they would change - but it didn't work. \n\nThink a new thought to be kind enough for yourself to be honest in all your communication with your heart, mind, and soul. It is time to release your fantasies and take a step forward with deep feelings of commitment and care. Be true to you. Any negative thought makes you hurt more.

Excess emotions hurt the liver. Use your feelings wisely, and your liver will willingly support you. \n\nSeek wisdom and spiritual understanding of this life's experiences. Truth is the highest priority. You can do it, trust yourself. Nourish yourself with appropriate foods to strengthen you in your resolve. \n\nLearn the meaning of true respect. You can't respect others unless you respect yourself. And you can't respect yourself if you have to be right and need to argue. A responsible character doesn't need to use anger, resentment, bitterness, or sadness to prove a point.

Find and write down what is important to you. Be honest with yourself and be true to what is true to you. Keep your values, stand up for yourself without force or bitterness. Replace inner resentment with peace. Let the heaviness of life be the burden of the angels or the universe. \n\nWhy carry the past as if you could change by trying? The past can be your teacher if you let life be an experience and a discovery. Real strength never comes from anger or wishing.

Teach your mind and heart how to deal with their agendas and judgments. You may feel that they are trying to control you. See how the control of others comes from their insecurities. Learn to detect their insecurities so that you can breathe and move easier when they are acting out. \n\nChange doesn't happen overnight, but it does happen. It takes determination and a refusal to give up. Believe that healing is possible and heal from the inside out. Your joints and life need a chance to accept the simple things, the simple love, the simple experience, the simple thoughts. The complexities of life are difficult but are sought by many because they are afraid of the quiet and calm. \n\nNotice, are you afraid of the stillness? Your body is forcing you to be still. Take the opportunity of your restrictions to find the bliss in sharing and caring. Be open to let your heart release that deep and old sadness. You have tried your whole life to care; however, you forgot to express your own emotional pain, while taking care of the pain of others. Make room for the love by releasing everything that is not light and love, and you will be more receptive to the healing of the universe.",

      "summaryNegative": "Your stiff attitude is getting the best of you. \nThe emotional stiffness can be stubbornness towards others or to yourself. It also is a resistance to dealing with life events. \nFurthermore, you may not realize that your stiff muscles are trying to keep you aware of other problems in the body and the fear of dealing with all your issues. \nFear, worry, and frustration eventually wear the body down until the muscles stiffen up. \nWhen you become stiff and inflexible, you use it as a protection. \nSometimes you may not realize what you are protecting yourself from. The reason for this ignorance is that you have allowed your unconscious body to take over the role of being your protector. \nYou don't feel safe. \nYou are not sure what to do next, feeling like there are high stakes involved. \nYou are harsh on yourself or others about mistakes. \nFear keeps you resisting any change, but you come across as a know it all. \nCheck this app for the specific body area for more details. ",
      "summaryPositive": "Start with stretching your body slowly and for several minutes. Breathe deeply and slowly. Your determination is good, but your stubbornness is not. \n\nLearn to be firm and not tight. Learn to be focused, not obsessive. Learn to be honest with expressing your feelings and not suppressing them. Learn the difference between the ego and the core self. The ego is demanding and stubborn. The core self is confident and proactive. Connect to your true core self in order to strengthen your ability to be flexible, directed, productive, and motivated.\n\nBe forgiving of your mistakes because the resistance to experimenting with life will tighten you up. Life happens and so flow with the learning and growth. Find joy in the journey, lead by example, and find a sense of adventure in your experiences. ",

When you nourish your heart with food, it hurts your stomach, and it makes matters worse. Food is for nourishment but not for fixing and hiding problems. Sadness makes your stomach sluggish. Anger makes your stomach hurt. Fear makes your stomach ache. Your power could be in conscious living by heart and mind. Allow your mind and heart to work together.

This self-sabotage angers you. \nYou have stuffed the emotional pains while refusing to feel or express the truth of what has hurt you. \nYou essentially refuse to stand up for yourself, due to insecurity and a belief that perhaps you are better off seen, and not heard. \nYou want to be understood so much that you swallow your pride and your resentment. \nWith suppression, you hurt inside while the outside world has not a clue of your inner struggles.

All humans, animals, plants, and the earth have a worth that comes from the universe and the divine. How you express that worth is what is troubling. If a person believes they lack confidence and courage, that doesn't translate to worth, that translates to the capacity to act or react in a given situation. It is a false pride that causes you to be-little yourself. Begin by finding people that you can share a part of your passion, heart, talents, interests with. Release the false pride that compensates for the insecurity. \n\nReal confidence comes from being aligned and true to your values, acting on them, and honoring yourself more than what others say about you. Remember, inner resentments to yourself or others are an excuse to not change. Stop the madness of blame and resentment and turn the pages over to self-forgiveness, self-acceptance, honesty, integrity, and respect for yourself and others.

      "summaryNegative": "You are pre-occupied with the \"doing\" of life and less attentive to the \"being.\" \nYou had the will to push forward, but you continued to use more energy than your body wanted to give. You eventually collapsed, but still, you then forced it more. Then you finally gave up when there was little 'steam' left. This 'up and down' energy was confusing to the body and mind. It gave rise to the 'up and down' type of communication with people. You can't be totally honest with them because you want it to be a certain way, but sometimes your body and mind go in different ways. \nWith inner conflict about your communication with others, you now want to speak your truth. However, you worry that others will judge or criticize you, so you modify your conversations: always adjusting and silently suffering. \nTowards those who don't want this crazy, 'in and out, back and forth' way of communicating, you have become convinced that you are right, and some bitter feelings rise up against those who question or doubt you. Now, you are desperate from sensing an unmet need, and you are feeling powerless to change it.\nYour actions are now a pattern of negative self-talk that leads you to believe either you are a victim to your circumstances, or that you are above the rules. They don't apply to you but don't know what you want. If this shows up with food, your body and heart will suffer.\nYou feel it isn't fair that others get what they want, but you don't. \nYou think that you work really hard at life, diets, projects, but it doesn't go your way. Subtle jealousy makes it even more difficult to get up and take action. \nYou are in a disastrous negative self-talk cycle that is spinning you down into feeling ostracized and resentful. It is leading your body into a defensive state of protection and leads to physical sluggishness that reflects this shielding against emotions. \nYou wonder, 'why has everyone else figured out life and why do happiness, success, and love come to them so easily?' \nYou are sinking with embarrassment and screaming to be heard by those who you remain convinced have no respect or interest in you. This behavior elicits negative responses, which then reinforces those same feelings and beliefs. A vicious cycle ensues. ",
      "summaryPositive": "The core self, residing deep within, needs honesty about life. Write down your feelings and beliefs. Pay attention to your daily thoughts and actions. You'll notice that you're only harming yourself with your thoughts, feelings, and actions. It's not everyone else causing your problems.\n\nNow, take a look at yourself. You tend to blame yourself more than others, but recognize the truth that you're not the problem. What you need is some guidance on how to grow, follow through, clear the \"dirty\" air of negative thoughts, and embrace discovery and adventure instead of desperation and resentment.\n\nAny desperate or resentful feelings you experience are indicators that you're listening to the wrong boss inside your head and heart. Your true core self desires the best for you, reminding you to prioritize self-care rather than being scattered, harboring resentment, or shutting down. You're amazing. Connect with that part of yourself, even if it's a gradual process. Begin by slowly creating new patterns of thought and action. Humans are entirely capable of change, but if you're stubborn, inflexible, and burdened with regrets, change becomes more difficult.\n\nIt is time to see things differently, even if it is hard to understand. You think the false belief that they have to understand you and change for you to move forward. That will get you nowhere. Rethink and challenge the beliefs that you are a victim, or that you are above the rules. \n\nThe same air is offered to all, so breathe it fully without filtering it with misbeliefs and harmful feelings. Open your mind and eyes to observe your gradual change daily until it is a fundamental part of you. \n\nTreat yourself and others gently, with a full understanding that your body, and the bodies of others, are human and deserve respect, kindness, and not resentful judgment. As you do this, trust that the riddle of love, success, and happiness will be apparent to you. Your opportunity to share your insights will come. ",

I have to worry all the time.\" Thus, your worry is your boss. You are a slave to the constant concern that reaps no benefit nor positive consequence. \nWorry doesn't solve problems; it just makes sure you remember that you have problems. Maybe you should hire someone to call you every hour with a worry so that the rest of the hour you go about your daily living. ;)\nWorry is a consequence of not trusting life. \nYou are letting your mindset focus on your worrying thoughts, believing that thinking them will prevent your scary situation. However, it only magnifies it. \nWorry is addictive, and the mind responds to the adrenaline produced by worry with spinning more biochemicals in the brain to keep the worry going.\nBlood sugar is up and down, which leads to food issues and fatigue or hyperactivity in the body or mind. \nWorry is a false path because it does not have an outlet or completion.",

That means to breathe with interval breathing, walk to connect with your natural surroundings. Find a moment that your thoughts are simply of nature or other simple things. \n\nSince worry goes in the opposite direction of a solution, you will know what direction NOT to go to. The path to finding the common ground of the 'simple' first, allows the mind to rest and the heart and body to catch up. Being out of control and lost in the fog of confusion is not the worst thing, but always staying in the worry could lead you to the worse things. \n\nThe challenge of finding clarity is quite rewarding if you embrace the worry like you would a small child.
