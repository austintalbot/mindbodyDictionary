# Image Files - Naming Convention

## Important: Filename Requirements

Image files in this directory **must not** contain colons (`:`) in their filenames, as colons are not valid path characters on some file systems (particularly Windows).

## Renamed Files

The following files have been renamed to replace `:` with `-`:

- `Craving: Breads1.png` → `Craving- Breads1.png`
- `Craving: Breads2.png` → `Craving- Breads2.png`
- `Craving: Chocolate1.png` → `Craving- Chocolate1.png`
- `Craving: Chocolate2.png` → `Craving- Chocolate2.png`
- `Craving: Cold Dairy1.png` → `Craving- Cold Dairy1.png`
- `Craving: Cold Dairy2.png` → `Craving- Cold Dairy2.png`
- `Craving: Gluten1.png` → `Craving- Gluten1.png`
- `Craving: Gluten2.png` → `Craving- Gluten2.png`
- `Craving: Ice Cream1.png` → `Craving- Ice Cream1.png`
- `Craving: Ice Cream2.png` → `Craving- Ice Cream2.png`
- `Craving: Salty Foods1.png` → `Craving- Salty Foods1.png`
- `Craving: Salty Foods2.png` → `Craving- Salty Foods2.png`
- `Craving: Sex1.png` → `Craving- Sex1.png`
- `Craving: Sex2.png` → `Craving- Sex2.png`
- `Craving: Spicy Foods1.png` → `Craving- Spicy Foods1.png`
- `Craving: Spicy Foods2.png` → `Craving- Spicy Foods2.png`

## Placeholder Files

The current PNG files in this directory are 1x1 pixel placeholder images. They should be replaced with the actual images from Azure Blob Storage when available.

## Future Images

When adding new images to this directory, ensure filenames:
- Do not contain colons (`:`)
- Use dashes (`-`) or underscores (`_`) as separators instead
- Are compatible with cross-platform file systems
